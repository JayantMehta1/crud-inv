# Inventory-Tracker-CRUD
I created an inventory tracker which has CRUD capabilities along with the ability to restore recently deleted items.
Technologies used include Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Demo
1) Users can add a new item to the inventory item list and specify details such as the item name, quantity, and relevant comments.

![Add New Item](./screenshots/insertitem.jpg?raw=true "Add New Item")

2) Users can view a list of all active items within the inventory. Options available include editing item details and deleting items.

![View Inventory](./screenshots/itemlist.jpg?raw=true "View Inventory")

For example, the second item (pen) can be edited.

![Edit Item](./screenshots/editeditem.jpg?raw=true "Edit Item")

It also reflects in the main inventory list after being edited.

![Edited Item Reflection](./screenshots/editeditemlist.jpg?raw=true "Edited Item Reflection")

Deleted items are displayed here.

![View Deleted Inventory](./screenshots/deleteditem.jpg?raw=true "View Deleted Inventory")

3) If a user accidently deleted an item, they can restore it using the recently deleted items list.

![Restore Item](./screenshots/restoreditem.jpg?raw=true "Restore Item")
